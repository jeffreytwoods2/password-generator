# password-generator

Programmed the Javascript behind a password generator that creates a password according to the following criteria, gathered from the user:

- Password length?
- Includes lowercase characters?
- Includes uppercase characters?
- Includes numbers?
- Includes symbols?


I used Math.floor and Math.random to select Unicode characters by their numerical index, which were added into the password according to whether they matched the user's criteria.
